<td>It was a blast! We won 3 silver medals and 3 bronze. This was around <span class="highlight">January, 2025</span>. My first ever time going into the finals at the Division Palaro along with kuya Jeremy, my school partner.</td>
<td>Our last division experience. At the end of the year, <span class="highlight"> December, 2025.</span> Second place overall with 4 silver 3 bronze.</td>
<td>The campus was so big! I got placed 6th in Youth C Latin, and 5th in Youth A, which was great since I'm only technically a junior, not youth. This was around <span class="highlight"> April, 2025 </span></td>
<td>Tiresome, but crowned first place in Junior C Standard, second in Junior A, plus fifth in the Junior Duo. Still, <span class="highlight"> 2025, </span> but now <span class="highlight"> October </span> This time, I'm partnered with RJ.</td>
